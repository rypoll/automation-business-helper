can you give me a description of a realistic sample small/medium business, telling me the tech and online tools they use and the processes they use in order to service their business (an example of tech is a crm platform like hubspot, or use instagram for marketing - think about all the tools/tech they use in their company from crm stuff, to marketing, to all the sectors of the business).

these processes should be common processes company uses. 

keep your resposne brief, mentioning as many tools a company uses. give a brief description of what a company does

im creating fake companies and tech they use so i can do a case study on the tech/tools they use in their company.

you should aim to tell all of this in 150 words

The company must be an marketing company.
