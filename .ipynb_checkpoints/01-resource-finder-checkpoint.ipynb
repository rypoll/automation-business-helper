      "No-Code Bootcamp: How to Choose the Right One\n",
      "Oct 18, 2023\n",
      "You've heard about no-code and how it’s enabling non-developers to build software without having to write code. Determined to ride this wave, you are now looking for the no-code bootcamp that will help you level up your skill set.\n",
      "There is one issue though: With so many different no-code bootcamps out there, how do you choose the right one? \n",
      "Before we jump into the details of making this decision, let’s take a brief look at what a no-code bootcamp is. \n",
      "What is a no-code bootcamp?\n",
      "No-code bootcamps are educational programs designed to teach participants how to leverage no-code platforms to build software applications, automations, or workflows. \n",
      "It all starts with your goals\n",
      "There is no one-size-fits-all program, and choosing the right no-code bootcamp starts with defining your goals. What do you actually want to get out of such a program? \n",
      "To help you define these more clearly, you should first answer the following questions:\n",
      "Which topic do you want to learn about?\n",
      "What level of proficiency do you wish to achieve?\n",
      "What is the best way for you to learn?\n",
      "1. Which topic do you want to learn about?\n",
      "Did you know that there are not one but two no-code trends and that they are very distinct from each other?\n",
      "First up, there’s no-code software development, which empowers you to build applications without traditional coding. If you want to launch an MVP or build your own app, you should focus on learning everything about this topic.\n",
      "The second sub-trend is no-code operations. Here, the focus is on business process automation. You will learn how to leverage no-code tools to automate workflows, connect tools with each other, and build custom internal tools.\n",
      "While both are worth diving into, it’s best if you choose to focus on one. \n",
      "Learning no-code is a long journey, and being clear on which topic matters the most to you is the best thing you can do. You can always come back to the other one later.\n",
      "2. How proficient do you want to become?\n",
      "Are you looking for an intro or do you want to go pro?\n",
      "Being clear about the level of proficiency you’d expect to have is a fundamental step to choosing the right program. \n",
      "Bootcamps will usually fall into either of these two categories:\n",
      "Introductory bootcamps are your gateway to the no-code universe. Whether it’s no-code software development or no-code operations, these programs help you start from scratch and grasp the fundamentals.\n",
      "Expert bootcamps are designed for those committed to becoming skilled no-coders. These are your go-to if you're aiming to become a professional no-code developer or a bona fide automation specialist, capable of handling intricate automation projects.\n",
      "Introductory bootcamps are great to get a first taste of the topic and build some initial momentum, but there is still a ton you won’t know by the end of these programs. \n",
      "On the other hand, proficiency bootcamps are more comprehensive but this comes at a price: they’re more expensive, take more time, and are more difficult to complete.\n",
      "Here again, there is no right or wrong option - be clear about what you are looking for.\n",
      "3. What is the best way for you to learn?\n",
      "Selecting the right bootcamp is also about finding a learning approach that jives with your professional obligations and personal preferences.\n",
      "Some examples:\n",
      "If accountability is what makes you stick to your commitments, look for a bootcamp with a strong, supportive community, ideally with peer groups.\n",
      "If you need the energy and interactivity of live sessions to learn, opt for a cohort-based program.\n",
      "On the other end, if you are too busy with work to commit to a schedule, go for an asynchronous program.\n",
      "How much time each week can you realistically dedicate to the program?\n",
      "In a nutshell, align your preferred learning style with the bootcamp's methodology. Don’t make commitments you will break later on.\n",
      "Closing remarks\n",
      "A few more remarks that did not fit in the framework I shared above:\n",
      "No-code is a broad, rich topic to explore. Be wary of programs claiming they cover everything.\n",
      "Integration platforms like Make are the Swiss knives of no-code: whichever your way is - no-code development or no-code ops - learning an integration platform like Make is a must.\n",
      "Makers are the best teachers. Learn from people who are building and practicing what they teach on a daily basis.\n",
      "Look for programs designed for you. If past students have similar backgrounds and experience, that’s usually a good sign.\n",
      "Embarking on a no-code journey is an exciting endeavor - whether you are exploring the basics or aspiring to become a proficient no-code builder - don’t hesitate to go for it. It can truly be transformative.\n",
