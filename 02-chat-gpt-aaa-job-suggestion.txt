I'm looking at being a freelancer that automises things for companies using the following tools:

* Make.com
* Manychat
* Voiceflow - what are its integrations?
* Highlevel
* instantly
* Botpress
* StackAI
* Zapier
* Airtable
* Hubspot


I want to know what are the best things I can offer to companies, what automations can I offer them, that offers the best ROI and that it is scalable such that the thing I offer can be templated and almost copy and pasted to other companies (this means I can start to make this a business).

The tools I listed above are ones I know can be used to automate things, but you may know more.

I'm basically looking at what are the best, most impactful services I can sell to people. Once I know that, I can start cold calling and generating leads, explaining to potential clients the benefits of implementing my services.

Give specific services/projects I can do for clients, so I know specifically the details of what I can offer and also so I'm able to explain in detail the product I will be selling. Also explain why it is useful and the potential hours saved by a full time employee per week.


Try to come up with as many ideas I can sell as possible. 

--- OUTPUT ---



Certainly! Let's dive into specific automation services you can offer using the tools you've mentioned, detailing their utility and potential hours saved for a full-time employee.

Customer Support Chatbots:

Tools: Manychat, Botpress, Voiceflow, StackAI
Service: Create automated chatbots to handle frequent customer queries, reservations, FAQs, etc.
Utility: Reduces the need for constant human intervention, ensures 24/7 response availability, and provides instant replies.
Hours Saved: Up to 15-20 hours/week for a business with moderate to high inquiry rates.
Automated Sales and Lead Funnel:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Tools: Highlevel, Manychat, Zapier, Hubspot
Service: Develop a system to automatically nurture leads via email campaigns, personalized follow-ups, and segmentation.
Utility: Increases conversion rates, ensures no lead is overlooked, and provides personalized customer journeys.
Hours Saved: 10-15 hours/week depending on the volume of leads.




1. Overview:
Sales and lead funnels are vital processes in any sales-driven organization. They represent the journey a potential customer takes from the first touchpoint to the eventual sale (or conversion). Automating this process can reduce human error, speed up the sales cycle, and ensure that every lead is appropriately nurtured.

2. Tools Used and Their Roles:

Highlevel: This is a platform designed for agencies to automate many parts of the digital marketing process. For this funnel, Highlevel can manage CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tasks, automate follow-ups, and track lead progress.

Manychat: Primarily a chatbot tool, Manychat can capture leads from websites or social media platforms. It can qualify these leads based on predefined criteria and then pass the relevant information to a CRM or email marketing tool.

Zapier: An automation tool that connects different applications, Zapier can transfer data between these tools. For instance, if Manychat captures a lead, Zapier can send this data to Highlevel or Hubspot for further nurturing.

Hubspot: A comprehensive marketing, sales, and service platform. It can serve as the CRM, manage email campaigns, segment leads based on behavior or demographics, and automate many parts of the lead nurturing process.

3. The Service in Detail:

Lead Capture: Using Manychat, you can set up chatbots on client websites or social media to engage visitors. These chatbots can capture details and qualify leads based on set criteria.

Data Integration: With Zapier, you ensure that the data captured from various sources (like Manychat) gets integrated into Hubspot or Highlevel. This seamless transfer ensures no leads are lost in the shuffle.

Email Campaigns: Once the leads are in Hubspot or Highlevel, you can design automated email campaigns. These emails can educate the lead about the product/service, offer special deals, or share testimonials.

Personalized Follow-Ups: Not all leads convert immediately. Based on the lead's interaction with your emails (e.g., which ones they open, which links they click), you can send personalized follow-up emails. These can address specific pain points or interests the lead has shown.

Segmentation: Over time, you'll gather more information about the lead. This data allows you to segment them into more specific categories. For example, a lead interested in "Product A" can be segmented away from those interested in "Product B". Such segmentation ensures more targeted and effective nurturing.

4. Utility and Benefits:

Increases Conversion Rates: Automated funnels ensure that leads receive consistent, relevant communication. Such regular touchpoints, tailored to the lead's interests, significantly increase the chances of conversion.

No Lead Overlooked: Manual processes can result in overlooked or forgotten leads. Automation ensures every lead is nurtured until they convert or explicitly opt out.

Personalized Customer Journeys: Automation tools can track a lead's behavior, ensuring that the communication they receive is tailored to their interests and previous interactions. This personalization enhances the lead's experience and further boosts conversion chances.

5. Efficiency and Time Saved:
A manual process involves individuals sending out emails, manually inputting lead data into CRMs, following up based on memory or basic reminders, and trying to analyze lead behavior without integrated analytics. Automating these tasks not only ensures consistency and accuracy but also frees up significant time. The 10-15 hours saved per week can then be redirected towards more strategic initiatives, like refining the sales strategy, exploring new markets, or improving the product/service based on feedback.


--------------------------------------------------------




Voice-Enabled FAQ and Info Assistants:
Tools: Voiceflow
Service: Implement voice assistants to answer common queries, provide info about products/services, or guide users.
Utility: Enhances user experience, especially for voice-centric platforms or users with accessibility needs.
Hours Saved: 5-10 hours/week depending on inquiry frequency.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Integrated Workflow Automation:
Tools: Zapier, Airtable, Hubspot, Make.com
Service: Connect various apps to automate workflows, e.g., automatically updating CRM when a new lead is captured or setting reminders for follow-ups.
Utility: Eliminates manual data entry, reduces human error, and streamlines processes.
Hours Saved: 10-20 hours/week depending on the intricacy of workflows.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Visualization Dashboards:

Tools: Airtable, Make.com, Hubspot
Service: Set up dashboards that automatically gather and visualize key metrics for businesses, like sales trends, customer demographics, etc.
Utility: Offers real-time insights, aids decision-making, and ensures data-driven strategies.
Hours Saved: 5-10 hours/week previously spent on manual data analysis.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Event and Appointment Automation:

Tools: Highlevel, Hubspot
Service: Automate appointment scheduling, reminders, and event registrations.
Utility: Reduces no-show rates, improves customer experience, and ensures timely follow-ups.
Hours Saved: 5-8 hours/week depending on the frequency of appointments/events.


vent and Appointment Automation

1. Overview:
Handling events and appointments manually can be a tedious task for businesses, especially those with a high frequency of such activities. Missing an appointment or failing to remind a client about their booking can have financial implications and tarnish a company's reputation. Automation ensures that these processes run smoothly, reducing errors and enhancing the customer's experience.

2. Tools Used and Their Roles:

Highlevel: Primarily a platform for digital marketing tasks, Highlevel also offers features like appointment booking, reminders, and CRM integrations. It can be used to handle the entire lifecycle of an appointment or event, from booking to follow-up.

Hubspot: Known for its robust CRM, Hubspot also offers marketing automation features. Within the context of events and appointments, Hubspot can manage registrations, send reminders, and track attendee behavior.

3. The Service in Detail:

Appointment Scheduling: Using the built-in features of Highlevel or Hubspot, clients can let their customers book appointments online. This can be integrated with the client's calendar, ensuring no double bookings or scheduling conflicts.

Automated Reminders: Once an appointment or event registration is made, the system can automatically send out reminders as the date approaches. This can be done via email or SMS, ensuring the attendee is well-aware and prepared.

Event Registrations: If the client hosts webinars, workshops, or other events, Hubspot can handle registrations. It can capture attendee details, send out event materials, and even integrate with webinar platforms for a seamless experience.

Post-Event/Appointment Follow-ups: After an event or appointment, automated follow-up emails can be sent. This can be a thank you note, a feedback survey, or promotional material for the next event.

Attendance Tracking and Analysis: Especially for events, it's crucial to know who attended, who missed out, and why. Such analytics can inform future event strategies. For appointments, tracking no-shows can help in further refining the reminder process.

4. Utility and Benefits:

Reduces No-Show Rates: Automated reminders ensure that attendees are reminded of their commitments, reducing the chances of them missing out.

Improves Customer Experience: A seamless booking experience, regular reminders, and post-event follow-ups make the customer feel valued and well-serviced.

Ensures Timely Follow-Ups: The period immediately after an event or appointment is crucial for gathering feedback or promoting further services. Automation ensures that this window isn't missed.

5. Efficiency and Time Saved:
Without automation, businesses rely on manual methods like phone calls, manual calendar entries, and manually sent emails for reminders and follow-ups. This not only increases the risk of errors but also consumes significant time. By automating these tasks, businesses can save between 5-8 hours a week, which can be better utilized for strategizing or refining services.

When approaching potential clients with this service, the key selling points should be the tangible benefits: reduced no-shows (direct impact on revenue), improved customer experience (enhanced reputation and potential for repeat business), and the efficiency gained (cost-saving). Showcasing previous success stories or even a brief demo of how the system works can further solidify your pitch.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feedback Automation System:

Tools: Manychat, instantly
Service: Implement systems to automatically solicit feedback post-purchase or post-service, then analyze and visualize this feedback.
Utility: Enhances product/service based on feedback and improves customer relations.
Hours Saved: 5-7 hours/week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Inventory and Order Automation:

Tools: Airtable, Zapier
Service: Automate inventory checks, order placements, and supplier communications based on triggers.
Utility: Reduces stockouts, streamlines ordering, and improves supplier management.
Hours Saved: 10-15 hours/week for businesses with significant inventory.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employee Onboarding and HR Processes:

Tools: Hubspot, Airtable, Zapier
Service: Automate the onboarding process, from sending out initial documentation to scheduling orientation sessions.
Utility: Ensures a consistent onboarding experience, reduces HR manual tasks, and accelerates the onboarding process.
Hours Saved: 5-8 hours/week, especially for companies with frequent hires.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Automated Marketing Reports:

Tools: Hubspot, Make.com
Service: Set up systems that automatically generate and send marketing performance reports at regular intervals.
Utility: Keeps stakeholders informed, supports data-driven decisions, and reduces manual report generation.
Hours Saved: 3-6 hours/week.



Automated Marketing Reports

1. Overview:
Marketing reports play a pivotal role in informing stakeholders about the performance of various marketing initiatives. However, manually collating data, analyzing it, and then creating reports can be a time-consuming process. Automating these reports ensures timely updates, reduces the risk of human error, and enables marketers to focus on refining their strategies rather than getting bogged down in data collation.

2. Tools Used and Their Roles:

Hubspot: As a comprehensive marketing and sales platform, Hubspot collects vast amounts of data on website traffic, lead generation, conversion rates, and more. It has built-in analytics and reporting features that can be customized to showcase the metrics most relevant to the client.

Make.com: While I'm not familiar with Make.com as of my last update in January 2022, assuming it is a tool related to report creation or data visualization, it can be used to design visually appealing reports or dashboards that can be shared with stakeholders.

3. The Service in Detail:

Data Integration: Ensure that all relevant marketing data sources are integrated with Hubspot. This might include social media accounts, Google Analytics, email marketing platforms, etc.

Custom Report Design: Using Hubspot's reporting features (or integrating with Make.com, if applicable), design custom reports that highlight the key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to the client. This might include metrics like website visits, lead sources, conversion rates, and ROI on specific campaigns.

Scheduled Report Generation: Set up Hubspot to automatically generate these custom reports at defined intervals, be it weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.

Automated Distribution: Once the reports are generated, they can be set to be automatically emailed to a list of stakeholders. This ensures timely distribution without manual intervention.

Interactive Dashboards (if applicable with Make.com): If Make.com supports it, create interactive dashboards that stakeholders can use to dive deeper into the data, filtering by date ranges, campaigns, or other relevant parameters.

4. Utility and Benefits:

Keeps Stakeholders Informed: Regular, timely reports ensure that all decision-makers are always updated on marketing performance.

Supports Data-Driven Decisions: With regular insights into how various marketing initiatives are performing, businesses can make more informed, data-driven decisions.

Reduces Manual Report Generation: Automation eliminates the repetitive task of manual report creation, reducing the risk of errors and freeing up time.

5. Efficiency and Time Saved:
Manually pulling data, analyzing it, creating visual representations, and then distributing reports can easily consume hours every week, especially for comprehensive reports. Automation can streamline this process, potentially saving 3-6 hours each week.

E-commerce Automations:

Tools: Manychat, Zapier, Voiceflow
Service: Implement chatbots for product recommendations, voice interfaces for shopping, and workflows for order processing.
Utility: Enhances shopping experience, reduces cart abandonment, and streamlines order handling.
Hours Saved: 10-15 hours/week depending on e-commerce volume.
Remember, the hours saved are rough estimates and can vary based on the size of the company and the volume of tasks. The key to your pitch is to emphasize not just the hours saved but also the increase in accuracy, consistency, and the value of allowing employees to focus on more strategic tasks.
